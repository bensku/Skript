    <b>Skript</b> is (surprise, surprise) a scripting plugin for the Bukkit platform. It is easy to use for simple tasks, but you can also create really complex things with it. The syntax of Skript is close to English, but it is still not magic. While you might succeed with experimentation for simple tasks, for anything more complex you will need some guidance.

  <p>
    This is Skript's documentation. You will find all supported features of the plugin here, along with some useful examples. We don't have tutorials yet, but you can find good ones using whatever search engine you prefer.

    <strong>We are looking for docs authors!</strong>
    Currently, the only documentation is generated automatically. It would be
    nice to have some hand-written content such as tutorials on the docs as
    well. For example, currently we don't have a tutorial on how to use loops
    here; This makes it harder for newcomers to learn. Check
    <a href="https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/issues/611">this issue</a> for
    more details and if you're interested in helping out.
